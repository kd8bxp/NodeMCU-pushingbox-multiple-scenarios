# NodeMCU (ESP8266) Arduino Code for Pushingbox (Multiple Scenarios)

## Usage

Example of a FAKE water sensor - With three different trigger levels, HIGH MEDIUM and LOW.   
This code uses the Arduino IDE (1.6.7 at time of this writting), with the NodeMCU boards installed. 
This may work with other ESP8266 boards, but has not been tested on anything other than the v0.9 and v1.1 NodeMCU boards.

# NodeMCU (ESP8266) Arduino Code for Pushingbox

## Usage

Example of a button push - originally for usage of a door bell notifier, but can be used for other thing.  
This code uses the Arduino IDE (1.6.7 at time of this writting), with the NodeMCU boards installed. 
This should work on other ESP8266 boards, but has not been tested on anything other than the v0.9 and v1.1 NodeMCU boards.
